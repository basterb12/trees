Dat Processing: How to run data processing for Measurements from Atmotube and gps.

On phone (iPhone12):
Atmotube Pro: (1) Start Atmotube Pro (40min warmup) - (2) disconnect from Atmotube app (Settings-device-unpair) - (3) find and connect Atmotube in “nRF Connect” app by Nordic - (4) Activate all available downloads from client (nrF Connect-connect ATMOTUBE-client-select all download icons) - (5) export data (ATMOTUBE-log-share).

GPS: Trip Logger Remote (by Frank Dean) - (1) Settings-Local logging-period:1sec, distance:none, enabled; Accuracy:best, minimumHDOP:5metres, seektime:none, max activity history:1,000(max) - (2) Start - (3) Stop - (4) Tracks-select-share.


On computer (macOS Sonoma 14.4.1; Python 3.11.5 using Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4 in Anaconda 2.6.0):

(1) Rename input file from sensor data adding 'YYYY-MM-DD_LL_'* to 'OG-FILENAME.txt'.
*LL is a 2 character site classifier
Sites are: LL - Lewisham-Lewisham; NC - New Cross; A2 - Southwark Old Kent Road (A2); ST - Sydenham testing

Requirements: requires scripts ‘import.config.json’ , ‘import_data.py’ , ‘sensor_file_parser.py’ , ‘sens.tree.comb.py’.

(2) import.config.json : specify input and desired output file paths.
(3) sens.tree.comb.py : specify input sensor and gpx files (line 37-39).

In console: (1) navigate to directory containing scripts - (2) python import_data.py INPUT_FILENAME.TXT - (3) python sens.tree.comb.py
.
Outputs: (1) ‘DATE_interp_sensor_gpx.csv’ (in Output/Output - air_location), (2) 'DATE_air_tree_matched.csv' (in Output/Output - air_tree_distance), (3) 'DATE_[TREESINRADIUS]_all_air_tree_data.csv' (in Output/Output - all_air_location_tree)
created in specified output directory. Files contain (1) matched sensor and gpx data; (2) sens+gpx data mached with tree database; (3) sens+gpx+trees including distances to trees and tree characteristics.


Test R Scripts for data analysis using a GAM in mgcv are located in 'Test scripts' folder. T-test using R for adjacent tree, non-tree air quality relationships in same folder.
Scripts use Output (3) files. Still being worked on.
